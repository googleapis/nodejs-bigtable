/**
 * Takes a row as input and produces an alternate view of the row based on
 * specified rules. For example, a RowFilter might trim down a row to include
 * just the cells from columns matching a given regular expression, or might
 * return all the cells of a row but not their values. More complicated filters
 * can be composed out of these components to express requests such as, "within
 * every column of a particular family, give just the two most recent cells
 * which are older than timestamp X."
 *
 * There are two broad categories of RowFilters (true filters and transformers),
 * as well as two ways to compose simple filters into more complex ones
 * (chains and interleaves). They work as follows:
 *
 * * True filters alter the input row by excluding some of its cells wholesale
 * from the output row. An example of a true filter is the `value_regex_filter`,
 * which excludes cells whose values don't match the specified pattern. All
 * regex true filters use RE2 syntax (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax)
 * in raw byte mode (RE2::Latin1), and are evaluated as full matches. An
 * important point to keep in mind is that `RE2(.)` is equivalent by default to
 * `RE2([^\n])`, meaning that it does not match newlines. When attempting to
 * match an arbitrary byte, you should therefore use the escape sequence `\C`,
 * which may need to be further escaped as `\\C` in your client language.
 *
 * * Transformers alter the input row by changing the values of some of its
 * cells in the output, without excluding them completely. Currently, the only
 * supported transformer is the `strip_value_transformer`, which replaces every
 * cell's value with the empty string.
 *
 * * Chains and interleaves are described in more detail in the
 * RowFilter.Chain and RowFilter.Interleave documentation.
 *
 * The total serialized size of a RowFilter message must not
 * exceed 4096 bytes, and RowFilters may not be nested within each other
 * (in Chains or Interleaves) to a depth of more than 20.
 *
 * @property {Object} chain
 *   Applies several RowFilters to the data in sequence, progressively
 *   narrowing the results.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Chain]{@link google.bigtable.v2.Chain}
 *
 * @property {Object} interleave
 *   Applies several RowFilters to the data in parallel and combines the
 *   results.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Interleave]{@link google.bigtable.v2.Interleave}
 *
 * @property {Object} condition
 *   Applies one of two possible RowFilters to the data based on the output of
 *   a predicate RowFilter.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Condition]{@link google.bigtable.v2.Condition}
 *
 * @property {boolean} sink
 *   ADVANCED USE ONLY.
 *   Hook for introspection into the RowFilter. Outputs all cells directly to
 *   the output of the read rather than to any parent filter. Consider the
 *   following example:
 *
 *       Chain(
 *         FamilyRegex("A"),
 *         Interleave(
 *           All(),

 *
 *   Despite being excluded by the qualifier filter, a copy of every cell
 *   that reaches the sink is present in the final result.
 *
 *   As with an Interleave,
 *   duplicate cells are possible, and appear in an unspecified mutual order.
 *   In this case we have a duplicate with column "A:B" and timestamp 2,
 *   because one copy passed through the all filter while the other was
 *   passed through the label and sink. Note that one copy has label "foo",
 *   while the other does not.
 *
 *   Cannot be used within the `predicate_filter`, `true_filter`, or
 *   `false_filter` of a Condition.
 *
 * @property {boolean} passAllFilter
 *   Matches all cells, regardless of input. Functionally equivalent to
 *   leaving `filter` unset, but included for completeness.
 *
 * @property {boolean} blockAllFilter
 *   Does not match any cells, regardless of input. Useful for temporarily
 *   disabling just part of a filter.
 *
 * @property {string} rowKeyRegexFilter
 *   Matches only cells from rows whose keys satisfy the given RE2 regex. In
 *   other words, passes through the entire row when the key matches, and
 *   otherwise produces an empty row.
 *   Note that, since row keys can contain arbitrary bytes, the `\C` escape
 *   sequence must be used if a true wildcard is desired. The `.` character
 *   will not match the new line character `\n`, which may be present in a
 *   binary key.
 *
 * @property {number} rowSampleFilter
 *   Matches all cells from a row with probability p, and matches no cells
 *   from the row with probability 1-p.
 *
 * @property {string} familyNameRegexFilter
 *   Matches only cells from columns whose families satisfy the given RE2
 *   regex. For technical reasons, the regex must not contain the `:`
 *   character, even if it is not being used as a literal.
 *   Note that, since column families cannot contain the new line character
 *   `\n`, it is sufficient to use `.` as a full wildcard when matching
 *   column family names.
 *
 * @property {string} columnQualifierRegexFilter
 *   Matches only cells from columns whose qualifiers satisfy the given RE2
 *   regex.
 *   Note that, since column qualifiers can contain arbitrary bytes, the `\C`
 *   escape sequence must be used if a true wildcard is desired. The `.`
 *   character will not match the new line character `\n`, which may be
 *   present in a binary qualifier.
 *
 * @property {Object} columnRangeFilter
 *   Matches only cells from columns within the given range.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [ColumnRange]{@link google.bigtable.v2.ColumnRange}
 *
 * @property {Object} timestampRangeFilter
 *   Matches only cells with timestamps within the given range.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [TimestampRange]{@link google.bigtable.v2.TimestampRange}
 *
 * @property {string} valueRegexFilter
 *   Matches only cells with values that satisfy the given regular expression.
 *   Note that, since cell values can contain arbitrary bytes, the `\C` escape
 *   sequence must be used if a true wildcard is desired. The `.` character
 *   will not match the new line character `\n`, which may be present in a
 *   binary value.
 *
 * @property {Object} valueRangeFilter
 *   Matches only cells with values that fall within the given range.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [ValueRange]{@link google.bigtable.v2.ValueRange}
 *
 * @property {number} cellsPerRowOffsetFilter
 *   Skips the first N cells of each row, matching all subsequent cells.
 *   If duplicate cells are present, as is possible when using an Interleave,
 *   each copy of the cell is counted separately.
 *
 * @property {number} cellsPerRowLimitFilter
 *   Matches only the first N cells of each row.
 *   If duplicate cells are present, as is possible when using an Interleave,
 *   each copy of the cell is counted separately.
 *
 * @property {number} cellsPerColumnLimitFilter
 *   Matches only the most recent N cells within each column. For example,
 *   if N=2, this filter would match column `foo:bar` at timestamps 10 and 9,
 *   skip all earlier cells in `foo:bar`, and then begin matching again in
 *   column `foo:bar2`.
 *   If duplicate cells are present, as is possible when using an Interleave,
 *   each copy of the cell is counted separately.
 *
 * @property {boolean} stripValueTransformer
 *   Replaces each cell's value with the empty string.
 *
 * @property {string} applyLabelTransformer
 *   Applies the given label to all cells in the output row. This allows
 *   the client to determine which results were produced from which part of
 *   the filter.
 *
 *   Values must be at most 15 characters in length, and match the RE2
 *   pattern `[a-z0-9\\-]+`
 *
 *   Due to a technical limitation, it is not currently possible to apply
 *   multiple labels to a cell. As a result, a Chain may have no more than
 *   one sub-filter which contains a `apply_label_transformer`. It is okay for
 *   an Interleave to contain multiple `apply_label_transformers`, as they
 *   will be applied to separate copies of the input. This may be relaxed in
 *   the future.
